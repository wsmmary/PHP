How is above sequence generated?
nâ€™th term in generated by reading (n-1)â€™th term.

The first term is "1"

Second term is "11", generated by reading first term as "One 1" 
(There is one 1 in previous term)

Third term is "21", generated by reading second term as "Two 1"

Fourth term is "1211", generated by reading third term as "One 2 One 1" 

and so on
